In the main content area under "Discovery," there is instructional text: "Discover and connect to private trackers. Connect Torrent Vibe to our API credentials. Enable at least one private before searching." Below this is a section titled "M-Team 5.0k," described as: "Search movies from your Team, use an active API key with https://api.m-team.cc." It includes configurable fields: "API URL" pre-filled with "https://api.m-team.cc" for the API endpoint; "API Key" as an empty input field for entering a personal API key to authenticate with the M-Team tracker; and "Results per page" set to "20" for controlling the number of search results displayed per page. At the bottom, there are buttons: "Reset" to clear or revert changes to the fields, and "Save" to apply and store the configured settings. Additionally, there is a "General" label or tab near the input fields, possibly for switching to broader settings within the Discovery section.
