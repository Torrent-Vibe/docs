# Connection Settings

The Connection settings panel allows you to configure how Torrent Vibe connects to peers, manages network traffic, and optimizes torrent performance.

## Peer Connection Protocol

### Peer Encryption
Control encryption requirements for peer connections:

- **Disabled**: No encryption requirements
  - Connects to both encrypted and unencrypted peers
  - Maximum compatibility but less secure

- **Enabled**: Require encrypted connections
  - Only connects to peers using encryption
  - Better privacy but may reduce peer availability

- **Forced**: Force outgoing encryption
  - All outgoing connections use encryption
  - Best security but may impact connection speed

### Anonymous Mode
Enhanced privacy features:

- **Enable Anonymous Mode**: Activate privacy protections
  - Disables peer exchange of IP addresses
  - Reduces tracking capabilities
  - May impact download speeds

## Listening Port

### Port Configuration
Set up the port for incoming connections:

- **Port**: Network port for torrent connections
  - **Default**: 6881 (BitTorrent standard)
  - **Range**: 1024-65535
  - **Random**: Generate random available port

- **Use UPnP / NAT-PMP**: Automatic port forwarding
  - **Enabled**: Automatically configure router
  - **Disabled**: Manual port forwarding required
  - **Recommended**: Enable for home networks

## Network Optimization

### Connection Limits
Control network resource usage:

- **Global maximum connections**: Total number of peer connections
  - Default: 500
  - Increase for faster networks
  - Decrease if bandwidth is limited

- **Max connections per torrent**: Limit connections for each torrent
  - Default: 100
  - Balance bandwidth across multiple torrents
  - Prevent a single torrent from using too many resources

### Bandwidth Management
Fine-tune network usage:

- **Speed limit**: Set maximum upload/download speeds
  - Prevents network saturation
  - Ensures bandwidth for other activities

- **Enable bandwidth scheduler**: Schedule speed limits
  - Configure different speeds for different times
  - Useful for managing bandwidth during peak usage

## Advanced Network Settings

### Proxy Configuration
Connect through a proxy server:

- **Proxy type**: None, HTTP, SOCKS4, SOCKS5
- **Host**: Proxy server address
- **Port**: Proxy server port
- **Authentication**: Username/password if required

### IP Filtering
Control which IPs can connect:

- **IP filtering**: Allow/block specific IP ranges
- **Filter list**: Import/export filter lists
- **Auto-update**: Keep filters up to date automatically

## Security Considerations

### Encryption Best Practices
- **Home networks**: Use "Enabled" for balanced security
- **Public WiFi**: Use "Forced" to ensure maximum security
- **Corporate networks**: Use a VPN with forced encryption

### Port Forwarding
- **Router settings**: Enable UPnP for automatic configuration
- **Manual forwarding**: Forward the configured port to your computer
- **Firewall**: Allow Torrent Vibe through the firewall

## Performance Tuning

### Fast Connection (100+ Mbps)
```
Port: 6881
Global connections: 1000
Connections per torrent: 200
Encryption: Disabled
UPnP: Enabled
```

### Limited Bandwidth
```
Port: Random
Global connections: 200
Connections per torrent: 50
Encryption: Enabled
UPnP: Enabled
```

### High Security
```
Port: Custom (5xxxx)
Global connections: 500
Connections per torrent: 100
Encryption: Forced
Anonymous Mode: Enabled
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Cannot connect to peers:**
- Check firewall settings
- Verify port forwarding
- Test port accessibility

**Slow connection speeds:**
- Adjust connection limits
- Check encryption settings
- Monitor peer quality

**Port forwarding issues:**
- Disable/enable UPnP
- Check router configuration
- Use port checking tools

### Network Diagnostics

**Test basic connectivity:**
- Ping known hosts
- Check DNS resolution
- Verify internet connectivity

**Monitor connections:**
- View peer list
- Check connection statistics
- Monitor bandwidth usage

**Advanced troubleshooting:**
- Enable debug logging
- Check system firewall
- Test with different ports

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Connection Statistics
- View active connections
- Monitor connection success rates
- Track peer countries/regions (if enabled)

### Regular Maintenance
- Regularly clear connection cache
- Periodically update IP filters
- Monitor blocked ports
