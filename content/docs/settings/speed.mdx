The Speed settings panel allows you to control bandwidth usage by setting global and alternate speed limits for torrent downloads and uploads.

## Global Rate Limits

### Set Global and Alternate Rate Limits
Configure baseline speed restrictions:

- **Upload Limit**: Maximum upload speed
  - **∞ (Unlimited)**: No upload restrictions
  - **Custom**: Set specific limit in KiB/s
  - Affects seeding and overall network usage

- **Download Limit**: Maximum download speed
  - **∞ (Unlimited)**: No download restrictions
  - **Custom**: Set specific limit in KiB/s
  - Controls download bandwidth consumption

## Alternate Rate Limits

### Schedule Alternate Speed Limits
Set up time-based speed restrictions:

- **Alt Upload**: Alternative upload speed limit
  - Applied during scheduled periods
  - Typically lower than global limits
  - Example: 10240 KiB/s (10 MB/s)

- **Alt Download**: Alternative download speed limit
  - Reduced speed for off-peak hours
  - Helps manage bandwidth costs
  - Example: 10240 KiB/s (10 MB/s)

- **Schedule Alternate Rate Limits**: Enable time-based switching
  - **Enabled**: Automatically switch between global and alternate limits
  - **Disabled**: Always use global limits

## Speed Limit Types

### Global Limits (Always Active)
- Primary speed restrictions
- Applied 24/7 when alternate scheduling is disabled
- Can be changed manually anytime
- Default behavior for most users

### Alternate Limits (Scheduled)
- Secondary speed restrictions
- Applied during configured time periods
- Typically more restrictive
- Useful for off-peak hours or cost management

## Configuration Examples

### Home Network (Unlimited)
```
Global Upload: ∞
Global Download: ∞
Alternate Upload: 5120 KiB/s
Alternate Download: 10240 KiB/s
Schedule: Enabled (off-peak hours)
```

### Limited Data Plan
```
Global Upload: 1024 KiB/s
Global Download: 5120 KiB/s
Alternate Upload: 512 KiB/s
Alternate Download: 1024 KiB/s
Schedule: Enabled (peak hours)
```

### Business Environment
```
Global Upload: 2048 KiB/s
Global Download: 10240 KiB/s
Alternate Upload: 512 KiB/s
Alternate Download: 2048 KiB/s
Schedule: Enabled (business hours)
```

## Scheduling Options

### Time-Based Scheduling
- Set specific hours for alternate limits
- Useful for:
  - **Night time**: Reduced speeds during sleep hours
  - **Business hours**: Limited speeds during work
  - **Peak hours**: Cost-based restrictions

### Manual Override
- Temporarily change limits without affecting schedule
- Useful for:
  - **Large downloads**: Temporarily increase limits
  - **Background tasks**: Reduce limits for other activities
  - **Testing**: Verify speed test results

## Per-Torrent Speed Control

In addition to global limits, you can set individual torrent speeds:

1. Right-click on torrent in main list
2. Select "Set Speed Limits"
3. Configure custom upload/download limits
4. Overrides global limits for that torrent

## Performance Considerations

### Upload Speed Guidelines
- **Recommended**: 80-90% of maximum upload capacity
- **Reasoning**: Leaves bandwidth for other network activities
- **Impact**: Better download speeds and network responsiveness

### Download Speed Guidelines
- **Recommended**: 95-100% of maximum download capacity
- **Reasoning**: Maximize available bandwidth
- **Impact**: Faster completion times

### Speed Testing
- Use online speed tests to determine your connection limits
- Test at different times to account for network variability
- Adjust limits based on actual performance

## Monitoring Speed Performance

### Real-time Monitoring
- View current speeds in main interface
- Monitor speed graphs in statistics panel
- Track bandwidth usage over time

### Speed Limit Indicators
- **∞ icon**: Unlimited speed (no restrictions)
- **Number + KiB/s**: Active speed limit
- **Grayed out**: Limit not currently active

## Troubleshooting

### Speed Not Applying
- Check if alternate limits are active
- Verify per-torrent overrides
- Restart Torrent Vibe if needed

### Inconsistent Speeds
- Test actual internet connection
- Check for background downloads
- Monitor peer connections

### Speed Too Low
- Increase global limits gradually
- Check for ISP throttling
- Verify VPN/proxy configurations
