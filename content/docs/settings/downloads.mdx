## Default Path & Behavior

### Configure Default Path and Behavior
This section controls the basic download configuration:

- **Save Path**: Default location for downloaded files
  - Click folder icon to browse and select directory
  - Supports both local and network paths
  - Can be overridden per torrent

### When Adding Torrent
Control automatic behaviors when adding new torrents:

- **Create Subfolder**: Automatically create subfolders for torrents
  - **Off**: All files in main save path
  - **On**: Creates folder with torrent name

- **Start Torrent Automatically**: Begin download immediately after adding
  - **On**: Downloads start right away (default)
  - **Off**: Torrents added in paused state

- **Delete Torrent Files Afterwards**: Clean up .torrent files after adding
  - **Off**: Keep original .torrent files
  - **On**: Remove .torrent files after successful addition

## Torrent Management

### Advanced File Handling
Configure how Torrent Vibe manages downloaded files:

- **Pre-allocate Disk Space**: Reserve space before downloading
  - **Off**: Download as space becomes available
  - **On**: Reserve full file size upfront (faster but requires free space)

- **Append .!qb Extension**: Mark incomplete files
  - **Off**: Files have normal names during download
  - **On**: Adds .!qb to incomplete files (qBittorrent style)

- **Automatic Torrent Management**: Smart categorization
  - **On**: Automatically assign categories based on file types
  - **Off**: Manual category assignment only

- **Relocate When Category Changes**: Move files when re-categorized
  - **On**: Files move to new category's save path
  - **Off**: Files stay in original location

## Usage Scenarios

### For Media Libraries
```
Create Subfolder: On
Automatic Torrent Management: On
Pre-allocate Disk Space: On
```
Best for organizing movies, TV shows, and music collections.

### For Software Downloads
```
Create Subfolder: Off
Start Torrent Automatically: On
Delete Torrent Files Afterwards: On
```
Streamlined for quick software installations and updates.

### For Large Files
```
Pre-allocate Disk Space: On
Append .!qb Extension: On
Automatic Torrent Management: Off
```
Ensures sufficient space and prevents accidental use of incomplete files.

## Best Practices

### Storage Management
- Use dedicated drives for large download libraries
- Enable pre-allocation for SSDs to prevent wear
- Set up different save paths for different content types

### Organization
- Enable automatic management for consistent categorization
- Use descriptive category names
- Regularly clean up completed torrents

### Performance
- Pre-allocate space for better performance on mechanical drives
- Use subfolders to prevent filename conflicts
- Enable automatic starting for immediate downloads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient disk space" errors:**
- Check pre-allocation settings
- Verify available space in save path
- Clear temporary files

**Files not organizing correctly:**
- Review automatic management rules
- Check category configurations
- Verify file type associations

**Slow download starts:**
- Disable pre-allocation for slower drives
- Check disk I/O performance
- Verify antivirus exclusions

### Recovery Options
- Manually move files and update torrent locations
- Use "Force recheck" for corrupted downloads
- Reconfigure save paths as needed
