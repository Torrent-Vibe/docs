description: Managing multiple qBittorrent servers and connections
---

Torrent Vibe supports connecting to multiple qBittorrent servers, enabling flexible torrent management across different locations and setups.

## Server Configuration

### Adding a Server

For detailed server configuration steps, see [Servers Settings](../settings/servers.mdx).

### Server Types

**Local Server**
- Host: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `8080` (default)
- Use case: Same machine setup

**Network Server**
- Host: Local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
- Port: Configured port
- Use case: Same network access

**Remote Server**
- Host: Public IP or domain
- Port: Forwarded port
- Use case: External access

## Path Mapping

### Understanding Path Mapping

Path mapping translates file paths between your qBittorrent server and local system. For detailed configuration, see [Servers Settings â†’ Path Mapping](../settings/servers.mdx#path-mapping).

## Multi-Server Management

### Server Switching

**Primary Server**
- Main server for torrent operations
- Default server for new torrents
- Configurable in server settings

**Server Selection**
- Switch between configured servers
- Per-torrent server assignment
- Automatic failover options

## Best Practices

### Server Organization

**Naming Convention**
- Use descriptive server names
- Include location or purpose
- Example: "Home-Desktop", "Office-Server"

**Security Considerations**
- Use strong passwords
- Enable HTTPS for remote access
- Regular credential updates

### Performance Optimization

**Load Balancing**
- Distribute torrents across servers
- Balance network and storage load
- Monitor server performance

**Backup Strategy**
- Multiple server redundancy
- Regular configuration backups
- Disaster recovery planning
