# Adding Torrents

## Methods to Add Torrents

Torrent Vibe supports multiple convenient methods to add torrents: click the "+" button, drag-and-drop files, or paste magnet links directly.

## Torrent Configuration

### Basic Settings

**Save Path**
- Default location for downloaded files
- Can be overridden for individual torrents
- Supports custom directories

**Category**
- Organize torrents by type
- Create custom categories
- Automatic categorization available

**Rename**
- Optional custom name for the torrent
- Helps with organization

### Advanced Options

**Torrent Management**
- **Skip hash check**: Bypass integrity verification (faster but less safe)
- **Start torrent immediately**: Begin download right away
- **Sequential download**: Download files in order (better for media)
- **First/Last piece priority**: Prioritize beginning and end (good for previews)

## Batch Operations

### Adding Multiple Torrents

1. Select multiple .torrent files
2. Drag and drop all at once
3. Configure settings for all torrents
4. Apply same category and settings

### Magnet Link Lists

- Paste multiple magnet links
- One per line in the input field
- Process all links simultaneously

## File Selection

### Selective Downloading

After adding a torrent:
1. View file list in details panel
2. Check/uncheck files to download
3. Set priorities for individual files
4. Save disk space by skipping unwanted files

### Priority Levels

- **High**: Download first
- **Normal**: Standard priority
- **Low**: Download after others
- **Don't Download**: Skip file entirely

## Import Options

### From URLs

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
