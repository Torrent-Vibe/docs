# Performance Tuning

This guide helps you optimize Torrent Vibe for the best possible performance based on your system configuration and usage patterns.

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: macOS 10.15 or later
- **CPU**: Dual-core 2.0 GHz
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Storage**: 500 MB free space
- **Network**: 10 Mbps broadband

### Recommended Specifications
- **OS**: macOS 12.0 or later
- **CPU**: Quad-core 3.0 GHz or better
- **RAM**: 8 GB or more
- **Storage**: SSD with 1 GB free space
- **Network**: 50 Mbps or faster

## Initial Setup Optimization

### Memory Configuration

**For Low-End Systems**
```
Max Memory: 512 MB
Cache Size: 32 MB
Connections: 100 total, 50 per torrent
```

**For High-End Systems**
```
Max Memory: 2048 MB
Cache Size: 256 MB
Connections: 500 total, 100 per torrent
```

### CPU Optimization

**Processing Threads**
- **Hash Checking**: 2-4 threads (based on CPU cores)
- **Network I/O**: Asynchronous processing
- **UI Updates**: Separate thread for responsiveness

## Network Optimization

### Connection Limits

**Dial-up/DSL (Slow)**
```
Global Connections: 50
Per Torrent: 10
Upload Slots: 2
```

**Cable/Fiber (Fast)**
```
Global Connections: 200-500
Per Torrent: 50-100
Upload Slots: 5-10
```

### Protocol Settings

**Enable Performance Features**
- DHT: Enabled for peer discovery
- PEX: Enabled for peer exchange
- LSD: Enabled for local discovery
- uTP: Enabled for congestion control

### Speed Optimization

**Upload Speed Management**
- Set upload limit to 80-90% of maximum
- Reserve bandwidth for other applications
- Use alternate speed limits for off-peak hours

**Download Speed Management**
