# Performance Tuning

This guide helps you optimize Torrent Vibe for the best possible performance based on your system configuration and usage patterns.

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **OS**: macOS 10.15 or later
- **CPU**: Dual-core 2.0 GHz
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Storage**: 500 MB free space
- **Network**: 10 Mbps broadband

### Recommended Specifications
- **OS**: macOS 12.0 or later
- **CPU**: Quad-core 3.0 GHz or better
- **RAM**: 8 GB or more
- **Storage**: SSD with 1 GB free space
- **Network**: 50 Mbps or faster

## Initial Setup Optimization

### Memory Configuration

**For Low-End Systems**
```
Max Memory: 512 MB
Cache Size: 32 MB
Connections: 100 total, 50 per torrent
```

**For High-End Systems**
```
Max Memory: 2048 MB
Cache Size: 256 MB
Connections: 500 total, 100 per torrent
```

### CPU Optimization

**Processing Threads**
- **Hash Checking**: 2-4 threads (based on CPU cores)
- **Network I/O**: Asynchronous processing
- **UI Updates**: Separate thread for responsiveness

## Network Optimization

### Connection Limits

**Dial-up/DSL (Slow)**
```
Global Connections: 50
Connections per Task: 10
Upload Slots: 2
```

**Cable/Fiber (Fast)**
```
Global Connections: 200-500
Connections per Task: 50-100
Upload Slots: 5-10
```

### Protocol Settings

**Enable Performance Features**
- DHT: For peer discovery
- PEX: For peer exchange
- LSD: For local peer discovery
- uTP: For congestion control

### Speed Optimization

**Upload Speed Management**
- Set upload limit to 80-90% of maximum
- Reserve bandwidth for other applications
- Use alternative speed limits during off-peak hours

**Download Speed Management**
- Set download limit to 95-100% of maximum
- Monitor and adjust based on actual speeds
- Consider ISP throttling

## Disk I/O Optimization

### Storage Configuration

**HDD Optimization**
- Pre-allocate files to prevent fragmentation
- Use larger cache sizes
- Disable frequent disk writes
- Schedule defragmentation

**SSD Optimization**
- Smaller cache sizes (SSD is faster)
- Enable TRIM support
- Monitor write endurance
- Use SSD-specific settings

### File Management

**Download Organization**
- Use sub-folders for large libraries
- Enable automatic categorization
- Set appropriate save paths
- Monitor disk space usage

## Advanced Tuning

### BitTorrent Protocol Tuning

**Peer Management**
- Optimize peer selection algorithm
- Configure choking/unchoking of peers
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Monitor peer quality

**Tracker Communication**
- Configure announce intervals
- Add backup trackers
- Monitor tracker health
- Use trackerless torrents when possible

### Memory Management

**Cache Optimization**
- Adjust qBittorrent's disk cache size based on server RAM
- Configure memory limits in qBittorrent preferences
- Monitor memory usage via qBittorrent WebUI
- Regularly clear cache through qBittorrent settings

**Application Memory**
- qb-webui is a lightweight Electron app
- Memory usage depends on the number of torrents displayed
- Close unused tabs to reduce memory footprint
- Restart the application if memory usage is too high

## Performance Monitoring

### Built-in Monitoring

**Performance Metrics**
- CPU usage tracking
- Memory consumption graphs
- Network bandwidth monitoring
- Disk I/O statistics

**System Integration**
- macOS Activity Monitor integration
- Performance logging
- Issue alerting system
- Historical performance data

### External Monitoring

**System Tools**
- Use Activity Monitor for detailed stats
- Use Network Utility for network monitoring
- Use Disk Utility to check disk usage
- Use Console to view system logs

## Performance Issue Troubleshooting

### Slow Downloads

**Network Issues**
- Test internet connection speed
- Check for bandwidth limitations
- Monitor peer connections
- Verify port forwarding

**System Bottlenecks**
- Check CPU usage
- Monitor memory usage
- Verify disk I/O performance
- Close competing applications

### High Resource Usage

**CPU Optimization**
- Lower connection limits
- Disable unnecessary features
- Update to the latest version
- Check for background processes

**Memory Optimization**
- Close other memory-intensive applications
- Clear system cache
- Restart the application
- Check for memory leaks

### Disk Performance

**I/O Bottlenecks**
- Check disk space
- Defragment if using HDD
- Monitor disk health
- Consider upgrading to SSD

## Platform-Specific Optimization

**Electron Application Notes**
- qb-webui runs as an Electron app on all platforms
- Performance is mainly dependent on qBittorrent server configuration
- Network settings are managed through qBittorrent preferences
- File system performance depends on qBittorrent download location

**Cross-Platform Optimization**
- Use SSD storage for qBittorrent download directories if possible
- Ensure stable network connection to qBittorrent server
- Configure qBittorrent based on network conditions
- Monitor resource usage of qb-webui and qBittorrent
